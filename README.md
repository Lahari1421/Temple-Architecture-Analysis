# Temple-Architecture-Analysis
Built and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify Indian temple architecture into Dravidian, Nagara, and Vesara styles. The entire project was developed in Google Colab using TensorFlow and Keras, with all training notebooks, model files, and dependency requirements included for easy setup and reproducibility.
