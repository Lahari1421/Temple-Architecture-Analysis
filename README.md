 Temple Architecture Analysis

An AI system that can look at photos of Indian temples and identify their architectural style—whether it's Dravidian (South Indian with towering gateway structures), Nagara (North Indian with curved spires), or Vesara (a blend of both traditions).

Built using a Convolutional Neural Network and trained entirely in Google Colab, the model learns to recognize the distinctive features that define each style—the shapes, proportions, and patterns that make these ancient structures unique. It's a practical application of deep learning that helps identify and preserve knowledge about India's rich architectural heritage, making it accessible to anyone interested in exploring how AI can recognize the artistry and engineering of centuries-old temples.
